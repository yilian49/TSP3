# TSP3
Traveling salesperson problem part 3
by Vinay Gopalan O59966 and Yilian Liu Q75098

TSP3 simulates a tournament among demes using ‘tournament selection‘. The demes are now composed of ClimbChromosomes that are mutated based on their performance in a ‘local hill climbing‘.

We simulated with 100,000 iterations with a population size of 300 and a mutation rate of 0.3. Our baseline result is 17,477.4. Playing GA without tournaments gave us a result of 18061.1. 

With this project, playing tournaments gave us a score of 10268.9
